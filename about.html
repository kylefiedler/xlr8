    <h3>16 Year old buisness started by accedent.</h3>
    <p>XLR8 was started in 2002 by accident!  Robby and Deidra Robertson bought the land and built the building in 2001.  The first tenant was Terry’s T’s followed by the dance studio and then, Little Stitches.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <p>Little Stitches had a four-head embroidery machine that was hard to get through the door.  Once it was in, Robby breathed a sigh of relief only to learn six months later that the owner went out of business and abandoned the machine.  Robby told Deidra that he was not moving “that thing” out of the building and to “make it work”.  The following Monday, Deidra had someone to run the machine and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>

    <h3>Kim Thomas</h3>
    <p><strong>Manager/Survivalist (see answer to deserted island question)
    </strong></p>
    <p>We asked Kim a few questions so you could know her better.  Pretty certain this did the trick.</p>
    <p>Favorite vacation place: My favorite place to vacation would be any beach any time anywhere with my grandkids Austin and Lily. I do not get to see them nearly enough and being with family is always been my favorite thing to do!</p>
    <p>Favorite movie: Tough one I love movies! The Sixth Sense and Dragonfly come to mind first because they stumped me. I never saw THAT coming. I do not watch them over and over though because they scare me!</p>
    <p>Actor or actress who would play you in a movie and what would the movie be called?  Goldie Hawn or Michelle Pfeiffer would do nicely playing me in a movie and I think it would be called My Crazy Life or maybe just Crazy Girl.</p>
    <p>Favorite TV show from 80’s or 90’s:  The Golden Girls was my favorite TV show of the 80”s and  90’S. I am not going to lie I still watch it and love them! The older I get the funnier I think they are.</p>
    <p>3 things you would take to a deserted island that fit in a backpack?  Smirnoff, Absolut and Patron.  No, no…really it would be a cooking pot, a knife and a large package of lighters. I would have more fun with the first three items!</p>
    <p> Traffic law you would change if you could:  I think the speed limit should vary with the amount of time you have left to arrive!</p>
